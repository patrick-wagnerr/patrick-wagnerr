## About Me


I am a postdoctoral researcher in political economy at University of Konstanz, in the [Cluster of Excellence "The Politics of Inequality"](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/en/inequality/). My motivation as a researcher is to understand the distributional impact of national and global political, economic, and environmental processes. Additionally, I am interested in the mitigating role of institutional and socioeconomic structures. Consequently, my research engages with multiple subfields of political science and economics including international relations, comparative politics, political economy, ecological economics, and industrial relations in a holistic approach to understanding political and economic phenomena. My core interests are encapsulated in a few basic questions:
- What are the macro- and micro-level determinants of the distribution of benefits/burdens imposed by trade, FDI, and climate change?
- How do political institutions and socio-economic structures influence this distribution and related policy choices?
- What role does the growing stature of emerging economies play in the global economy and international organizations?
